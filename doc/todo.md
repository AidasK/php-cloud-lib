# How to contribute and TODOs

There are still many things to do.

 * Write better documentation
 * Improve the tests
   Code coverage is actually quite good but there are a lot of tests that just use the code without really testing anything.
 * Write other/better words placers (see classes in `src/SixtyNine/Cloud/Placer`)
 * Write new filters or improve the existing one (`src/SixtyNine/Cloud/Filters`)
 * Improve the way the words are checked for collisions
 * New commands to generate/load/save lists and clouds
